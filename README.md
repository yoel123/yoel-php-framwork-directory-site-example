this is another example of how to use my php framework.</br>

like before its not about web design at all, its about calling and manipulating data from database<br>
and showing it to the user. it has the most minimalistic design.

everything is organised into folders as explained here:
<br>
https://github.com/yoel123/yoel-php-framwork-simple-blog-example
<br>
the system itself is a implantation of a business directory.<br>
in this implantation only the admin can add directory categorys and other data via admin panel.<br>
vistors can leave a review and use the contact form,search form and view all public data.<br>

pages:<br>
*main:shows all the parent categorys and has a search form by location and category<br>
*category:shows all the dirs in said category and the featured dirs, at the bottom are the child categorys<br>
of this category.<br>
*directory:holds the name ,img and description of the dir,dir gallery,conntact details,social links,conntact form,<br>
waze link,google map(with the dirs address from db) and a review form with stars for rating.
<br><br>
the admin is mostly ajax crud framework,check their site for more detail, its dead simple to use
(only logged in admin can use that part).

i didnt add any navigation,sidbar etc. i wanted it to be a bare bones example.
<br> chack the screenshots to see how it looks.
